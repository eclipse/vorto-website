When developing an Internet-of-Things solution, one can draw upon a wide variety of connected devices, interconnection protocols & management systems from a range of vendors. However, there is little interoperability between these components due to the disparate industry and vendor specific implementations of the device abstraction layer or information models.

At this IoT meetup event, <a href="http://projects.eclipse.org/user/4788" target="_blank">Alexander Edelmann</a> will provide an introduction to Vorto and lead a hands-on demonstration of how the tool can help you develop compelling IoT-enabled solutions using a broad range of components.
